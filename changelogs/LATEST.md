# v0.91.0

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Update with caution

This is the **alpha** version of a future update. It is designed to **test big changes** in the modpack.

Remember that while the Major version of the modpack starts with `v0.xx.x`, big breaking changes will sometimes happen.

In this version several big mods, such as `Nuclearcraft` or `Extreme Reacors` **have been removed** altogether, or replaced by other versions.

If you update from `v0.89.0`, this version will **remove your reactor builds** in the old world and may also cause irreparable world saving failures, so I recommend making a backup.

Please report bugs to the discord server:

> ‚úÖ If you are a regular E2EE enjoyer and do not want to suffer from crashes, bugs, uncraftable items - keep playing on version `v0.89.0`.
