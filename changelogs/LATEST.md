      > 
      > Whether to allow the item stack converter to push NBT data in
      > compressed format (GZIP'ed). This can be useful for pushing this
      > data back to other callbacks. However, given a sophisticated
      > enough software (Lua script) it is possible to decode this data,
      > and get access to things that should be considered implementation
      > detail / private (mods may keep "secret" data in such NBT tags).
      > The recommended method is to use the database component instead.
      > 
      > - Enable `enableInventoryDriver` and `enableTankDriver`
      > 
      > Whether to enable the inventory driver. This driver allows interacting
      > with inventories adjacent to adapters in a way similar to what the
      > inventory controller upgrade allows when built into a robot or placed
      > inside an adapter. It is therefore considered to be somewhat cheaty by
      > some, and disabled by default. If you don't care about that, feel free
      > to enable this driver.

      >   > - ![](https://is.gd/nolDMq "Battery Upgrade (Tier 2)") - 4,000,000 RF, harder recipe
      >   > - ![](https://is.gd/6QSkk3 "Battery Upgrade (Tier 3)") - 600,000,000 RF, way harder recipe

      > 
      > - x10 buff `bufferPerLevel`, now 50,000 RF
      > 
      > This is the amount of additional energy that fits into a robots
      > internal buffer for each level it gains.
      > 
      > - Buff `harvestSpeedBoostPerLevel` `0.02` => `0.033`
      > 
      > The increase in block harvest speed a robot gains per level. The time
      > it takes to break a block is computed as actualTime * (1 - bonus).
      > For example at level 20, with a bonus of 0.4 instead of taking 0.3
      > seconds to break a stone block with a diamond pick axe it only takes
      > 0.12 seconds.
