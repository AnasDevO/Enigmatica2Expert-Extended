  > 
  > 1.9.96
  > 
  > Beta Release - Hopefully fewer bugs than last time!

  > 
  > BIG WARNINGS
  > 
  > #1 BREAK ALL SOLAR TOWERS, SOLAR MIRRORS, AND ADVANCED COKE OVENS BEFORE UPDATING
  > 
  > #2 The steam turbine cycle has CHANGED. Your turbines will NO LONGER return water in the usual way.
  > 
  > #3 Combustion machines NO LONGER WORK IN VACUUM
  > 
  > #4 Some other heat processing machines NO LONGER WORK IN VACUUM OR HAVE REDUCED EFFICIENCY
  > 
  > #5 Delete configs so they will regenerate
  > 
  > Added in high pressure steam & high pressure steam turbine - they produce 24576 IF/t and are disabled by default, there only if people want to enable them and tweak them for stuff like NC compat (Silfryi)
  > 
  > High pressure steam turbine takes either tungsten if it exists or nickel for anything tungsten that does not exist (Silfryi)
  > 
  > High pressure steam turbine turns high pressure steam into normal steam for a cycle that requires two turbines (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Steam turbine steam output is now below shaft block (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Changed steam cycle to now require heat exchanging exhaust steam for hot water (Hot spring water from BOP if it exists) and running that through a cooling tower - Pumping water for this will be _hard_ to get that much water (Silfryi)
  > 
  > LARGE amounts of Advanced Rocketry compat
  > 
  > * Combustion now needs a oxygenated atmosphere to run in. No more boilers on the moon (Silfryi)
  > * Heat transfer now varies based on atmosphere heat conduction vs radiative heat radiation (Silfryi)
  > * Anything solar-related now varies based on AR insolation (sun brightness) values (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Temperatures are now normalized to sane values, not 12000 'temperature units', they're now normalized to ~600C, about the top of a standard turbine cycle today (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Advanced Coke Oven has been removed, but the bricks stay to allow packs to use them for other things. BREAK MULTIBLOCK BEFORE UPDATING (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Solar tower has been completely redone
  > 
  > * Now an actual solar concentrator tower design (Silfryi)
  > * Mirrors AND tower will need to be disassembled before updating or things WILL crash! (Silfryi)
  > * Molten sodium cycle can now be used for energy storage (Silfryi)
  > 
  > Added Melter, Solar Melter, and Electrolytic Crucible Battery for use in sodium production from salt (Silfryi)
  > 
  > 1.8.94
