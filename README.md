-----------------

## Principles and examples:

- ### No OP items
  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") Angel ring should not be so cheap to diable every other variants of creative flight*
  
- ### No exploits. Less cheese  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel Ingot") No more mob stripping farms for easy Terrasteel*

- ### Less miners -> more manual mining + processing  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Sieves gave you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in*

- ### Clear guide
  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Quest Book") More Quest Book chapters describing "forgotten" items*
  
- ### Tinker's Hegemony  
  Replace vanilla-like equipment with Tinker's Variants.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9u "Iron Chestplate") Iron - Diamond armor was removed, recipes replaced*
  
- ### Less crafting table -> more new crafting ways  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9g "Â§eInferium Essence") Mystical Agriculture Essence can be made in compressor*

- ### Tech - Magic - Exploration  
  This three ways more separated from each other, you chose your own way to enter late game  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9E "Pink Castle Rune Brick") Get Calcium Sulfite by recycling __Twilight Forest__ Castle*
