**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is an addon for [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The goal of the addon is to make E2:E even harder, "Expert of Expert" modpack.

## Less resources, Toughter mobs, Harder tools.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Most important of them:
 - `Scalling Health`
 - `Construct's Armory`
 - `Harder Branch Mining`
 - `Little Tiles`
 - `Rats`
 - `Tinker's Evolution`


See full list in [MODS.md](MODS.md)


-----------------

## Principles and examples:

- ### No OP items. No exploits. Less cheese.  
  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  Work towards crafting the powerful items, or use less powerful alternatives.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") The Angel Ring is harder to give way to all other flight options.*
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel") Ð¡an no longer be easily cheesed through the mob stripping farm..*

- ### Less miners -> more manual mining + processing  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Gave you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- ### Tinker's Hegemony  
  Material balance was reworked, OP traits remapped. Mobs spawn with random TCon's weapons.  
  *![](https://git.io/JGncx "Osgloglas") Is no longer the only correct option.*

- ### More adventuring  
  Better caves, additional structures, more loot, reworked planets.  
  *![](https://git.io/Jze1z "Rocket Assembling Machine") Added a variety of new resources and unique terrain on planets and other dimensions.*

- ### Clear guide  
  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Book") More Quest chapters describing "forgotten" items*
