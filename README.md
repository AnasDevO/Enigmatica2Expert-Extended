-----------------

## Principles of addon:

- No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  *Example: 💍 Angel ring should not be so cheap to diable every other variants of creative flight*

- Less Resource-generating machines -> more resource processing ways.  
  *Example: ▦ Sieves can give you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- More gain - harder recipe, no matter if item is hidden under "only experts knows about it".  
  *Example: ⛏ Atomic Disassembler got nerf*

- Keep "Mine" part from name "Minecraft" until endgame  
  *Example: 🪐 New Ore deposits on planets*
  
- Replace vanilla-like equipment with Tinker's Variants.  
  *Example: 🛡️ Iron - Diamond armor was removed, recipes replaced*
  
- Less crafting table recipes -> more new crafting ways.  
  *Example: 🔮 Mystical Agriculture Essence can be made in compressor*
  
- No exploits, less cheeses.  
  *Example: 🍫 No more mob stripping farms for easy Terrasteel*
