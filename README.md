**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is an addon for [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The goal of the addon is to make E2:E even harder, "Expert of Expert" modpack.

## Less resources, Toughter mobs, Harder tools.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Most important of them:
 - `Scalling Health`
 - `Construct's Armory`
 - `Harder Branch Mining`
 - `Little Tiles`
 - `Rats`
 - `Tinker's Evolution`


See full list in [MODS.md](MODS.md)


-----------------

## Principles and examples:

- ### No OP items. No exploits. Less cheese.  
  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  Work towards crafting the powerful items, or use less powerful alternatives.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") The Angel Ring is harder to give way to all other flight options.*
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel") Ð¡an no longer be easily cheesed through the mob stripping farm..*

- ### Less miners -> more manual mining + processing  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Gave you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- ### Tinker's Hegemony  
  Material balance was reworked, OP traits remapped. Mobs spawn with random TCon's weapons.  
  *![](https://git.io/JGncx "Osgloglas") Is no longer the only correct option.*

- ### More adventuring  
  Better caves, additional structures, more loot, reworked planets.  
  *![](https://git.io/Jze1z "Rocket Assembling Machine") Added a variety of new resources and unique terrain on planets and other dimensions.*

- ### Clear guide  
  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Book") More Quest chapters describing "forgotten" items*

## Developing strategy

This is unofficial addon and not supperted with **Enigmatica** dev team. But [NillerMedDild](https://github.com/NillerMedDild) (owner of E2) gave me some permissions, including posting on CurseForge (but with restrictions).

Addon would be posted on CurseForge after it advance from beta.

Right now im looking for testers and ideas feedback.
