	Phosphor (went from Phosphor 0.2.5 to Phosphor 0.2.6):
		Phosphor 0.2.6:
			This update addresses a small issue in Phosphor 0.2.5 where the mod could load on incompatible versions of SpongeForge.

			- Improved performance by using direct access into chunk sections when performing light updates

			- Fixed compatibility issues with recent SpongeForge releases (RC3844 and newer)

			- Fixed an issue where faulty mods could get around Phosphor's sanity checks and crash the game

			- Reduced the amount of logging that occurs at the INFO level to keep your terminal windows clean

			- Added a one-time message that is displayed after the mod is installed which links out to my Patreon. This can be disable in the configuration file by setting show_patreon_message to false.
