	Building Gadgets (went from BuildingGadgets v2.6.8 to BuildingGadgets-2.7.1.jar):
		BuildingGadgets-2.7.1.jar:
			See the full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

			[2.7.1 - 1.12.2] - 2019-07-23

			Fixed

			 * Fixed an issue causing the game to crash when using the material list key on anything but the Copy&Paste Gadget or air.
		BuildingGadgets-2.7.0.jar:
			Full Changelog [here](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

			Note:

			A note for this update, due to the pure amount of changes made between this version and the previous version we're just going to put it out there that this one might be a bit buggy! üêõ If you encounter any issues with how the mod used to work to how it works now please be sure to create a new issue on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/issues)

			Added

			 *  Added a new and fancy Material List GUI for templates. Simply shift right click with a template in your hand to see the list.
			 * With this you can also now copy the material list right into your clipboard!
			 * Some people where finding it hard to open the Copy & Paste Gadgets GUI in tight spaces so to help with this we've added a button in the Radial Menu (G) to go straight to it :)
			Changed

			 *  The Building and Exchanging Gadgets mode System, to make it more open for future additions. Thanks @hnOsmium001 for his PR.
			 * This also resulted in a lot of changes - please report any bugs you might encounter as a lot of the core functionality has been changed in this version.
			 * Updated the Destruction Gadget's GUI as it needed some scaling and usability work. It's better but it's not pretty! Soz.
			 * The destruction gadget now uses a different kind of magic for finding connected blocks. This should resolve any issues people have been having with less powerful computers and large selection ranges.
			 * Added slightly better handling of random crashes to hopefully reduce them... Wish us luck.
			Fixed

			 * Fix typo when pasting a link
			 * Fixed an issue where linked inventories (Yeah, you can link loads of them now. Just shift right click with a supported Gadget!) would stay highlighted in different dimensions.
			 * Fixed an odd one where linked inventories would throw out items if the dimension got deleted.
			 * Fixed an exploit where the Exchanging Gadget could be used as a way to mine large areas quickly.
			 * Fixed an issue with the new modes system using the Building Gadgets range in Build To Me mode which wasn't even close to right.
			For Devs

			 * We're now firing Break & Place block events for each of our tools semi correctly. We've not been able to do large scale tests so if you have any more issues then let us know.
