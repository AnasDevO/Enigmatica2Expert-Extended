Updated 9 files:
	Astral Sorcery (went from AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.19.jar to AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.20.jar)

	Better Questing (went from BetterQuesting-3.5.300.jar to BetterQuesting-3.5.311.jar):
		BetterQuesting-3.5.310.jar:
			Fixed minor translation error on quest logic tooltip

			Fixed auto-backup pulling the wrong mod's version info

			Fixed edit access not being updated after OP/DEOP command

			Changed participant arguments in tasks to include the active party members (expect more changes here in future)

			NOTE:

			- This will require updating expansions to be compatible again. Previous versions will not work (please stop mixing and matching versions)

			- Depending on how stable this version is, this will likely be the last beta build before resuming normal releases

			- There are more major rewrites planned in future but those are likely a few months away yet

			- This marks the end of the networking overhaul making questing servers a bit more friendly on players with weak connections

			- ...and no I'm not updating to 1.14.4 any time soon. Still quite a lot of work to do here before then
		BetterQuesting-3.5.309.jar:
			Fixed item selection screen crashing when air is given an ore dictionary name

			Fixed potential threading issue with unexpected shutdowns clearing databases before saving them

			Changed file writing process slightly

			Added texture_empty to possible theme texture options to hide GUI elements entirely
		BetterQuesting-3.5.308.jar:
			Fixed quest line reordering deleting everything instead

			Fixed quest line deletions not working

			Fixed quest tooltips not updating timers

			Changed repeat timers to be based on real time (still measured in ticks)

			Changed test theme scrollbars and inner panels

			Added the ability to switch between repeating based on completion time or fixed intervals (e.g. resetting every hour on the hour)
		BetterQuesting-3.5.307.jar:
			Fixed party invites not sending due to missing expiry timestamp

			Fixed invitations not syncing info about the inviting party

			Fixed party database not resetting when changing servers/worlds

			Fixed invitation database not resetting when changing servers/worlds

			Fixed desynced parties holding clients hostage

			Fixed GUIs not updating when names are updated

			Fixed valid invites not appearing if the party hasn't synced yet

			Fixed item selection editor forgetting the ore dictionary setting

			Fixed quest line icons not supporting ore dictionary cycling
		BetterQuesting-3.5.305.jar:
			Rewrote a significant amount of network handling to be less intensive on weak connections

			Fixed incorrect conversion of 1.7.10 item ID numbers

			Fixed party invitees being able to seize control during host migrations

			Fixed crash when sliced textures are sized incorrectly

			Fixed some NBT data being missing from item stacks

			Fixed fluids rendered in GUIs not using their assigned colours

			Fixed repeatable quest resets being sorted backwards

			Fixed default load not supporting legacy formats

			IMPORTANT NOTES:

			- Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.

			- This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

	Better Questing - Standard Expansion (went from StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar to StandardExpansion-3.4.167.jar):
		StandardExpansion-3.4.166.jar:
			Fixed retrieval task logic functioning back to front and detecting/eating everything except the items it was set for

			Fixed crafting tasks not saving any progression rendering them unusable

			Fixed fluid tasks not working at all when set to ignore NBT
		StandardExpansion-3.4.165.jar:
			Updated to support BQ 3.5.310
		StandardExpansion-3.4.164.jar:
			Fixed advancement tasks not using partial writes

			Fixed interact tasks breaking when attempting to sync partial data

			Added shared progress support back to crafting tasks

			Notes:

			I have been constantly re-thinking how to do progression sharing, dealing with offline players, ones that don't have the same unlocked quests, dupe exploitation, etc.

			There are a few solutions I have come up with but some may have more damaging side effects than others or not be backwards compatible. I encourage anyone who wants to give their input on these issues to contact me on the Discord and hopefully I can think of a new solution.

			PS: No I'm not going back to the old system where you could drag users to end game rewards. It was way too exploitable and has already been abused by players on servers.
		StandardExpansion-3.4.163.jar:
			Fixed loot chests throwing an error and disappearing

			Fixed location task inversion not including dimension checks
		StandardExpansion-3.4.161.jar:
			Updated to support BQ 3.5.305

			Fixed crash when JEI was not installed

			IMPORTANT NOTES:

			- Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.

			- This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

	Modular Machinery (went from ModularMachinery-1.12.2-1.10.0.jar to ModularMachinery-1.12.2-1.11.1.jar):
		ModularMachinery-1.12.2-1.11.0.jar:
			Also contains a huge amount of internal code changes. If you're making an MM addon and are lost with the new code changes, please come over to AstralSorcery's discord for guidance.

			Additions:

			- Added "canelIfPerTickFails" as a general recipe option (to be configured on the same level as "recipeTime") - which makes a recipe fail and VOID THE INPUTS if something that's supplied per-tick isn't supplied for one tick.

			- When hovering over a machine controller in the structure preview, the preview will offset and rotate itself to the rotation of the controller, so you can continue building the existing structure or check for structure mismatches.

			Fixes:

			- Fixed 2D layer preview being broken and shifted wrongly

			- Fixed recipe tooltips on JEI recipe previews rendering outside of the JEI GUI

			- Fixed per tick inputs being consumed twice if a per-tick recipe fails during a recipe and is not cancelled afterwards

			- Fixed item output sometimes not checking for output space properly, potentially voiding chanced outputs

	PackagedAuto (went from PackagedAuto-1.12.2-1.0.2.6.jar to PackagedAuto-1.12.2-1.0.2.7.jar):
		PackagedAuto-1.12.2-1.0.2.7.jar:
			Added some helper methods
			Reduced the data that crafting recipe infos write into NBT
			Made tiles send less data to clients
			Fixed loading a recipe from a recipe holder into a slot with the same recipe making the items in the pattern disappear
